# New UI, CLI

#### What is New UI?

New UI is a modern, semantic UI framework for building beautiful, accessible websites and apps. It gives you everything you need—foundations, components, theming, and smart utilities—designed to grow with you, from first launch to millions of users. Thoughtfully made for makers, small teams, and anyone who cares about great design.

#### Install

To set up the project, open your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
npx create-new-ui
```
